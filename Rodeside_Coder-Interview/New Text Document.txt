Suggested Sequence for One-Year Experience
1. Start with Basic String Manipulations:

Reverse a string
Count vowels, consonants, and characters
Remove spaces, duplicate characters, digits, etc.
2. Work with Palindromes and Substrings:

Check for palindromes
Check if one string is a rotation of another
Find the longest non-repeating substring
3. Move to Array Manipulations:

Find maximum, minimum, sum, and average of an array
Remove duplicates from an array
Check if an array is sorted or palindrome
4. Array Transformations and Grouping:

Rotate arrays, split into chunks, or flatten arrays
Group elements (even/odd numbers)
